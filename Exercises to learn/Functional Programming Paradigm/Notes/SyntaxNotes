Use """ """ for printing functions that take a string as input
Example: printfn $"""%A{foldReduce combineToString "" intList}"""

Use inline when constraining input variables to the operation used in the function e.g
let inline add (a: 'a) (b: 'a) : 'a =
    a + b
If inline wasn't used, 'a would be restricted to being an integer
but by using inline it can be any numeric type
