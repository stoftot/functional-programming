Function Pipeline with Algebraic Data Types
    Task: Define a Shape type (from the Algebraic Data Types task) 
    and create a function pipeline that accepts a list of shapes, 
    filters out rectangles with an area below a certain threshold, 
    and maps the remaining shapes to their areas.
    
    Principles: Higher-Order Functions, Algebraic Data Types
    
    Learning Outcome: This task demonstrates how algebraic data types 
    can be processed using higher-order functions like filter and map.
