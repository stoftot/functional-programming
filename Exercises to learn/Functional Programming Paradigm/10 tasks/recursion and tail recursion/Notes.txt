Tasks:
Additional Details:
Each task should provide practical insight into recursion and its tail-recursive counterpart.

Tasks like comparing efficiency (Tasks 7 and 9) 
can be extended to visualize memory or time usage differences.

Nested structures (Tasks 8 and 10) highlight more complex use cases of recursion in functional programming.
