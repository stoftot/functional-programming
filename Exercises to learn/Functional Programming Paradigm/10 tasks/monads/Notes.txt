Task:
Additional Notes:
Core Concepts: Tasks cover defining common monads (Maybe, Result, Writer, State), 
chaining computations with bind, and testing monadic laws.

Real-World Applications: Tasks include error handling, 
stateful computations, and structured parsingâ€”practical 
use cases for monads in functional programming.

Progression: Tasks gradually increase in complexity, 
starting with simple monads and culminating in monad transformers and law verification.
