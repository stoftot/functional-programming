Task 1: Implement the Maybe Monad
Goal: Create a Maybe<'T> type with cases Some of 'T and None. 
Implement a bind function to chain computations that may produce None.

Overview: Introduces the concept of monads, focusing on the ability 
to handle optional values in a functional style.


Task 2: Use the Result Monad for Error Handling
Goal: Define a Result<'T, 'E> type with cases Ok of 'T and Error of 'E. 
Implement a bind function for chaining computations that may produce errors.

Overview: Demonstrates error propagation using the Result monad 
and the utility of chaining dependent computations.


Task 3: Chain Maybe Monad Operations
Goal: Use the Maybe monad to implement a function 
that takes a list of numbers and returns the square root 
of the sum, or None if any number is negative.

Overview: Highlights chaining computations with bind and encapsulating failure scenarios cleanly.


Task 4: Validate Input with the Result Monad
Goal: Write a function validateUser that checks a user's username and password, 
returning Ok user if valid or an Error if invalid.

Overview: Demonstrates chaining multiple validations and propagating errors using the Result monad.


Task 5: Create a Writer Monad
Goal: Define a Writer<'T> type that pairs a value with a log. 
Implement bind to chain computations while accumulating logs.

Overview: Introduces the Writer monad and demonstrates 
how to track intermediate logs in a series of computations.


Task 6: Implement a State Monad
Goal: Define a State<'S, 'A> type to encapsulate computations that read 
and modify a state. Implement bind to sequence stateful computations.

Overview: Demonstrates the use of the State monad to handle mutable state in a functional style.


Task 7: Parse Using the Parser Monad
Goal: Define a Parser<'T> type to represent a computation that consumes input 
and produces a value. Implement bind for chaining parsers.

Overview: Highlights how monads can simplify complex parsing logic by sequencing dependent operations.


Task 8: Combine Two Monads
Goal: Write a function combine that combines the Maybe and Result 
monads, returning None or Error if either computation fails.

Overview: Demonstrates working with multiple monads and combining their 
behaviors to handle various computation scenarios.


Task 9: Test the Monad Laws
Goal: Write test cases to verify the three monad laws 
(left identity, right identity, associativity) for the Maybe monad.

Overview: Encourages understanding and proving the theoretical 
foundations of monads by testing the laws in practice.


Task 10: Create a Monad Transformer
Goal: Implement a MaybeResult<'T, 'E> monad transformer that 
combines the Maybe and Result monads. Write a bind function to work seamlessly with both.

Overview: Demonstrates advanced monadic concepts by stacking multiple 
monads for more complex computation patterns.
