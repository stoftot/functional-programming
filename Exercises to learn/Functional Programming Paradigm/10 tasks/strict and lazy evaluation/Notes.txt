Task:
Additional Notes:
Core Concepts: These tasks focus on understanding when 
and how computation happens with strict and lazy evaluation strategies in F#.

Real-World Use Cases: Tasks such as lazy file readers, infinite data streams, 
and prime number generators demonstrate practical applications.

Comparative Analysis: Tasks encourage comparing strict and lazy evaluation 
to appreciate their trade-offs in terms of performance, memory usage, and control over execution.
