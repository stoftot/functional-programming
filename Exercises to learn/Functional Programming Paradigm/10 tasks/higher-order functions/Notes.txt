Definition:
higher-order functions are functions that either:
- Take one or more functions as arguments: 
  This means they can accept functions as input, 
  allowing them to operate on or manipulate these functions.
- Return a function as their result: 
  This means the output of the higher-order function is itself a function, 
  which can be invoked later.

Characteristics of Higher-Order Functions
- Abstraction: They allow for abstracting control flows, 
  such as iteration, filtering, or mapping, in a reusable way.
- First-Class Functions: Higher-order functions rely on the concept 
of first-class functions, where functions are treated as values 
that can be passed around and manipulated like other data types.

Importance
Higher-order functions are a key tool for code reuse, 
modularity, and expressiveness, making them fundamental in functional programming paradigms.
