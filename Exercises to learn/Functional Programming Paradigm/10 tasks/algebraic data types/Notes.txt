Tasks:
Core Concepts: All tasks highlight the core ideas of algebraic data types, 
including discriminated unions, records, and pattern matching.

Practical Use Cases: Tasks are designed to reflect real-world scenarios, 
such as state machines, domain modeling, and tree structures.

Extensibility: Many tasks can be extended with additional functionality, 
such as validation, serialization, or advanced pattern matching.
