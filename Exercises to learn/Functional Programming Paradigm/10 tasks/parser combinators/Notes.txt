Task:
Additional Notes:
Core Concepts: Tasks highlight fundamental parser combinator techniques, 
including composing parsers (andThen, orElse), repeating patterns (many), and error handling.

Practical Applications: Tasks like arithmetic expression parsing, 
JSON parsing, and CSV handling provide real-world use cases.

Incremental Complexity: Tasks are structured to build on simpler parsers, 
gradually introducing more advanced combinator functionality.
